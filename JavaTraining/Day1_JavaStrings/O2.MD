## Immutable String in Java

~~~
String references are used to store various attributes like username, password, etc. In Java, String objects are immutable. Immutable simply means unmodifiable or unchangeable.

Once String object is created its data or state can't be changed but a new String object is created.
~~~

~~~
class Testimmutablestring{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Sachin";  
   s.concat(" Tendulkar");//concat() method appends the string at the end  
   System.out.println(s);//will print Sachin because strings are immutable objects  
 }  
}  
~~~

#### O/p

~~~
Sachin
~~~

~~~
Now it can be understood by the diagram given below. Here Sachin is not changed but a new object is created with Sachin Tendulkar. That is why String is known as immutable.

~~~
As you can see in the above figure that two objects are created but s reference variable still refers to "Sachin" not to "Sachin Tendulkar".

But if we explicitly assign it to the reference variable, it will refer to "Sachin Tendulkar" object.
~~~

~~~
class Testimmutablestring1{  
 public static void main(String args[]){  
   String s="Sachin";  
   s=s.concat(" Tendulkar");  
   System.out.println(s);  
 }  
}  
~~~
#### o/p 
~~~
Sachin Tendulkar

In such a case, s points to the "Sachin Tendulkar". Please notice that still Sachin object is not modified.

###
Why String objects are immutable in Java?

~~~

As the String object is immutable we don't have to take care of the synchronization that is required while sharing an object across multiple threads.

Heap Space:

The immutability of String helps to minimize the usage in the heap memory. When we try to declare a new String object, the JVM checks whether the value already exists in the String pool or not. If it exists, the same value is assigned to the new object. This feature allows Java to use the heap space efficiently.

### Why String class is Final in Java?

~~~
The reason behind the String class being final is because no one can override the methods of the String class. So that it can provide the same features to the new String objects as well as to the old ones.
