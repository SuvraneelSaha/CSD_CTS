### Difference between Cyber Security and Information Security 
~~~

what is the difference between cyber attack and information attack 

the diff is that when an attacker tries to steal info from a person via physical means or by any means it is known as information attack whereas the cyber attack is a narrow field where the attacker tries to exploit the person using attacks over the internet only . 

In most of the case of cyber security it is related to cyber crime , cyber law , cyber attacks , and cyber warfare (where one country attacks another country through cyber attacks on each other)
