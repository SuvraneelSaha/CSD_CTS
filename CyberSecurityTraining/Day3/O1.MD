~~~

[PHA Service Play Protect](https://developers.google.com/android/play-protect/client-protections)

~~~

On demand PHa Scan --
In addition to a lightweight, daily, automatic scan, users can start a full-device scan at any time. Upon request, the device contacts Google servers for the latest information and scans all apps on the device. If a harmful app is discovered, Google Play Protect notifies the user to take action or takes action on their behalf. This visibility gives users peace of mind that they have the latest protection at all times.


Offline PHa Scan --
PHA installations can occur when a device is offline or has lost network connectivity. To address this, Google Play Protect has offline scanning, which helps prevent well-known PHAs from being installed offline. When the device regains network connectivity, it undergoes a full scan.

~~~

~~~
Automatically disable PHAs
Some PHAs are more harmful than others and we treat them differently depending on the PHA classification. The most harmful PHAs are automatically removed from the device, while less severe PHAs are disabled. A disabled app is unusable but remains on the device, and any data associated with the app is recoverable. When an app is automatically disabled, users are notified and can make the decision to remove the app or re-enable it to make it usable again. If no action is taken, the app remains disabled.


~~~

~~~
Appeals
You can appeal your app's removal from Google Play. We will reinstate apps in appropriate circumstances, including if an error was made and we find that your app does not violate the Google Play Developer Program Policies and Developer Distribution Agreement.
