Essential Terminologies 

1. Exploit - vulnerability exploitation 

2. Effect of Hacking on a Business - 
    Loss of Reputation 
    Loss of Financial 
    Loss of Sensitive Data 

3. What is Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Assessment ? 
  - Pen test - find loop holes and security weakness in the software or application 

  Vulnerability Assessment - 
  -- 
  We use the tools to get the report what are the security weakness 

  By VA - we can get to know the security weaknesses 

  and by doing PEN Testing we can get the exploitation reports manually 

  In VA - Use of software is there 

~~~
Benefits of Pen testing and VA 
    1. time of VA < Time of Pen testing 
    2. Va is done with existing Knowledge 
    3. It can also miss the zero day attack 
    4. VA is cost effective due to automation 
    5. In Va there is a chance to get false positive 
    false positive - meaning fake loophole 
    6. Pen - More accurate 
    7. it can cover zero day attack 
    8. No false positive 
    9. skilled person Is needed to do PT 
    10. Expensive as compared to VA 
    11. Time expensive

Types of Penetration Testing ? 

--

3 types - 
Black Box , White Box and Grey Box 

White Box - Company has the code to do the code scanning

What are the 4 steps of Pen Testing ? 
~~~
Planning

scope and objective ,duration of the testing , whether i need to do the full pen test or the last changes that is needed to be made 


Intelligence Gathering 

- Includes the overview and walkthrough of the entire app 
Understanding of the app 
and what version is used 

Vulnerabilty Analysis - 
using the automated scanner or by doing the manual pen testing 

Reporting - 
report of the vulnerabilities 
and will submit to the client
