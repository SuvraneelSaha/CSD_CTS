Agenda is to get to know a DAST and SAST 

SAST - is static and it is running locally 


DAST -- is online and is in a dynamic state ie running on the server -- ACCunetix software 


Create a new project in sonar cube 
from the localHost 




use the repository link to download the master branch and extract it inside of a folder .

[the repository link](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)

SONARCUBE 



sonarsource -- download the community edition of sonarcube 

unzip the file and put the folder in the c drive 

Install the JDK 17 or more

add the path to the path variables 

got to the c drive - java bin folder and copy the path to the environment variables JDK 17 

add your sonar scanner bin folder path to the environment variables 

how to run -- sonar cube 

go to sonar cube - go to bin and inside the bin windows x64 

go to cmd and cd the path and 

./ sonar.bat 



DVWA master - this is avulnerable website 
and we need to scan it 

go to 

Now we have the code we can do now the SAST TESTING 

Yt - search sonarcube with dvwa website 

Dynamic -- WE have to scan the whole application 


SAST --- WE can use it to 


BWAPP -- buggy web application 

~~~

[BWAPP](http://www.itsecgames.com/download.htm)

this is also a vulnerable application 


Copy it and paste it in the c drive and extract it 
to a folder 

sql injection - vulnerability - so secure it 


Create local Project -- project name Bwapp 

use the global setting 

create this setting 

use locally 

Generate a project token 

which kind of so BWapp is on php -- so windows os 


there will be a token and copy it 


go to the same dir and open the cmd and paste the copied link 
and open it it will scan automatically 
it will give a analysis of all the buls available

Main goal is to generate the reports 

Paid softwares generate reports 

After the processing of all the things in the cmd

Go to the Security Hotspots 
It takes time to load the security hotspots 



BWapp and DVWA 

Get an IDEA what is SAST AND DAST  

To to a problem and go through and get to know how can i fix it 

for each problem there will be explanation and there will be tabs on how to fix it
