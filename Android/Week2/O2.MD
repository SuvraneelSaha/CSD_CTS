## Layout 

~~~
setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

What ever will be shown in the main_activity.xml then 
it will be shown in the actual app 

We are using constraint layout that is the reason it is giving errors 


~~~

### Inside the MainActivity
~~~
we can combine kotlin and java files in a single project 

we can change the launcher icon 

where we can change - we can change it inside the AndroidManifiest.xml file 

where we need to declare all the components and the permissions that are required 

Broadcast Receiver , Activity , Intents , Services and also Content Providers 
according to our requirements 

All the components withe the Permissions as AndroidManifest is the heart of any Android app 

application is the parent tag 
and all inside of it is the child tags 




~~~

## Strings.xml File 

~~~
All the Strings can be defined with the help of an id or you could say a class name just like in html 
ie here in this case we have to use the string name 

~~~

## Color.xml 

~~~
Same as like the Strings.xml file 
where we change the colors and also add custom colors 
~~~

## themes.xml 

~~~
for Design purpose , we can change it 
~~~


## Build.Gradle 

~~~
One is for application and 

Another is one for Project Level 

Application is the main one we are working with 

Version Code -- ie the app version number 
say for example we already have the app in the google play store and then we pushed some new updates then -- we the version code will get changed by +1 

VersionName - what version you want to put 
Decimals are preferred 

App level Dependencies -- 

For Example - we want to connect to a http server what 
kind of dependency we need to add 

we can just simply search it 

How to understand what dependencies we need 

-- In that case just google it Like I want to hit http server or a socket server and what are the dependencies that we need . 

Here we need to add the dependencies here . 

Http Library - here we can copy paste the dependency for the required http library dependencies 

and After Changing just Do Sync Now .
