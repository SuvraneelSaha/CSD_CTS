~~~
What we covered - Intents and the android architecture along with the features of the android studio 
~~~

## Intents : 

~~~
Explicit and implicit along with pending intent 
along with the what is the difference between the 3 
~~~

### Explicit Intent : 

~~~
Ex - from one screen to another screen ie from one activity to another activity 

here we already know the one activity to another activity 

Intent intent = new Intent(context,TargetActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);

We are already aware of the two activities 

~~~

### Explicit Intent 

~~~
We want to share a photo , and we want to share that photo 

In android device , if we want to share a photo there would be lots of options 

1st Step - select the image

2nd step - share - all the options of all the apps that the image can be shared 

3rd - select any one of the apps 

The TargetActivity is not explicitly mentioned 


~~~

~~~
Normal Implicit intent 
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setData(Uri.parse("https://www.abc.com"));
startActivity(intent);

here by using this above code we can open up a browser depending upon our own choice , ie it is implicit in nature and depends on the user 



// sending the Data via implicit Intent

Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
intent.setData(Uri.parse(path of your photo));
startActivity(intent);

the path of your photo will be selected from the user's choice 

We can create 100s of actions using implicit intent 





here the Action.view - this means we want to view something 

here also we can use ACTION_SEND  
The question can arise - which to use - ACTION_SEND OR ACTION_VIEW   

Just by searching the google on which ACTION TO USE IN CASE OF SENDING OF AN EMAIL OR WHEN SENDING OF A SMS OR VIEWING OF AN IMAGE 

WE WILL GET TO KNOW  


~~~

## Opening the Android Studio and Creating a New Project 
~~~
phone and tablet - android project 

activity - google map and different type of template projects will be present 


~~~

### WE will be creating with the help of the Empty Activity 

### Android Studio And Features of IT 
~~~
Select the empty activity and just give a name of the application 
location , languages and Minimum SDK 

Minimum Criteria to run an Android Application 

We can add jar libraries inside the lib folder 

res folder --> Drawable folder 

ic_launcher.xml file but in different folders 
cause of image resolution difference 

svg and vector images are best as it will be compatible with all kinds of resolutions
