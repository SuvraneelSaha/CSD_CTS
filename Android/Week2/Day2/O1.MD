## Android Activity Life Cycle 

~~~
Welcome
After onCreate()


-->> Main Activity 
then OnStart()
when we see the main Activity - OnResume()

--->> SecondActivity () 
for the mainActivity - onPause() and OnStop() 
these two methods will be called 

and in Case of another Activity - 
it will be (OnCreate() , OnStart() , OnResume())

whenever we click on a fresh Activity - definately onCreate() , OnStart() and OnResume() will be called 

this will always happen for any activity any fresh activity 

What Will happen when we go back from the second Activity to the main Activity 
back - means it will get destroyed and it will be removed from the stack memory . 
Back Button means - destroying the activity from the stack memory 




for second activity(onPause() , OnStop() , OnDestroy())


and here in this case for the main activity - main Activity(OnRestart() , OnStart() , OnResume())

why no OnCreate() - as it is in already in the stack Memory 

Just like a stack - 
the app which we recently open will be on top of the stack 

LifeCycles methods can also be modified by using programming and implementing the custom life cycle methods 


Point of starting in case of a large code base - OnCreate() function -- this will act as a entry point 


MainActivity(attachBaseContext())
this method will be called even before the onCreate() function 

it will be calling this method first 

it is a part of the lifecycle of the whole application from a application level context 

example - theme or color of the application will be set up by the attachBaseContext() method

Welcome - > MainAct (attachbasecontext()  This is for whole app context  , onCreate , onStart , onResume,onPause , onStop , onRestart,onStart, onResume)  - > Secondact (onCreate , onStart , onResume, onPause, onStop,onDestroy)

Can fragment exist without an Activity 
Fragement is the child of an Activity ie or Parent activity 

and why is that 

an Activity can exist all alone 
~~~

~~~
SetContentView they are inflating the view  the xml file 
inside the onCreate() method 

in case of fragment where it will inflate the view 
onCreate()


when we destroy a fragement - we will be executing 
onDestroyView() , onDestroy() and onDetach()
