for obfuscation of code 
as a reverse engineers to do RE 

Proguard is also there to obfuscate the code 
which both makes it even harder to do RE 
and this is where the client tools are taken help of to decompile the code

## Serializable 

~~~
in java there is a concept of Serializable 
where we want to put many files in a single bundle 

We want to put multiple data in a single file 

in case of Android we have Parceable 

and it is faster than Serializable 
its like a parcel 

in parcel we have multiple data and we will bundle it in a single class that is Parcelable 

So if we want to directly pass this class through Activity we can do that as well 

Previous we know how to pass data from one activity to another Activity 

In parcel we have multiple things or items 


~~~

## Passing a class using Parcelable through Activity 

~~~
1. we need to create the object of that class 
~~~

~~~
What we need to remember is that 
whenever there is a getter function there must be the presence of a setter function 

so it will be obvious for us To Decode whenever there is involvement of any kind of sensitive datas through these functions and also we will get to know about the source of the data 

These are known as POJO or Model Class 



~~~


## Passing a class through Serializable 

~~~
Its just like a simple java class , 
we pass by normal object creation and inside of the Serializable - there is only normal getter and setter functions and a constructor might be also present 


~~~

## Pending Intent 
~~~
It is like a task or a token which will be 
Executed after a certain amount of time or it will get triggered to be executed at a certain time . 

Ex- Alarm 

it is an Example of Pending Intent 
also notifications , Widgets 

Ex - song name that is shown as a notification and the song is playing in the background
