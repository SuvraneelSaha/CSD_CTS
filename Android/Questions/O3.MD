## Describe permissions in Android 

~~~
Android apps have limited permissions associated with them by default. If your app selected to apply “normal” permissions, the system automatically grants those without user input.

For permissions that extend beyond the scope of normal permissions, the user must explicitly grant those permissions. These are classified according to the following groups.

Permission groups

Permissions are divided into nine groups, allowing users to grant all permissions encompassed by a single action by bundling them together as a group. For...

Permissions are divided into nine groups, allowing users to grant all permissions encompassed by a single action by bundling them together as a group.

For example, to provide a user with permission to view, edit, and add Contacts, it’s more efficient to group these permissions into a single permission group (called Contacts) than to request each individually.

Permission Group	Description
Calendar	Managing calendars
Camera	Taking photos and
recording videos
Contacts	Managing contacts
Location	Current device location
Microphone	Audio recording
Phone	Dialing and managing
phone calls
Body Sensors	Heart rate and similar
data
SMS	Sending and viewing
messages
Storage	Accessing photos,
media, and files

A user may perform an action that demonstrates clear intent, such as:

Taking a picture
Selecting a contact
Starting a call or text message
In these cases, the user’s action clearly demonstrates their intent, and no permission dialog is needed or authorized.

Runtime permissions
Apps may request permission to access information or use device capabilities at any time after installation. When a user needs to perform an action in an app, such as using the device camera, the app may request permission at that moment.

Users may also allow or deny the permissions of any app from Android Settings anytime after installation.

Denied permissions
Provide feedback whenever a permission is denied. Because denying permissions may prevent a feature from working as intended, whenever a permission is denied it should be explained to the user.

Permission denials occur in one of two ways:

A permission request is denied by the user
A permission is silently denied without warning because a user once selected “Don’t ask again” from a previous permission request
To ensure that features requiring permission always behave as intended, the app should state that permission is needed and provide a way to allow it.
