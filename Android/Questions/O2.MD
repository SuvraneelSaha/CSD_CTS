In simple format -

|_ _ _ _ RESOURCES < Images, video files, Audio files, xml files, Language packs >

|_ _ _ _ NATIVE LIBRARIES < some native code that include c & c++ libraires >


github - An APK file is an archive that usually contains the following folders:

META-INF directory:

MANIFEST.MF: the Manifest file
CERT.RSA: The certificate of the application.
CERT.SF: The list of resources and SHA-1 digest of the corresponding lines in the MANIFEST.MF file; for example:

 Signature-Version: 1.0 
 Created-By: 1.0 (Android)  SHA1-Digest-Manifest:
 wxqnEAI0UA5nO5QJ8CGMwjkGGWE=  
 ...  
 Name: res/layout/exchange_component_back_bottom.xml  SHA1-Digest:
 eACjMjESj7Zkf0cBFTZ0nqWrt7w=  
 ...  
 Name: res/drawable-hdpi/icon.png 
 SHA1-Digest: DGEqylP8W0n0iV/ZzBx3MW0WGCA=
lib: the directory containing the compiled code that is specific to a software layer of a processor, the folder is split into more folders within it:

armeabi: compiled code for all ARM based processors only
armeabi-v7a: compiled code for all ARMv7 and above based processors only
x86: compiled code for x86 processors only
mips: compiled code for MIPS processors only
res: the directory containing resources not compiled into resources.arsc .

assets: a directory containing applications assets, which can be retrieved by AssetManager.

AndroidManifest.xml: An additional Android manifest file, describing the name, version, access rights, referenced library files for the application. This file may be in Android binary XML that can be converted into human-readable plaintext XML with tools such as AXMLPrinter2, apktool, or Androguard.

classes.dex: The classes compiled in the dex file format understandable by the Dalvik virtual machine

resources.arsc : a file containing pre-compiled resources, such as binary XML for example.



TechTarget : 
Contents of an Android Package Kit file
APK files contain all contents needed to run the application, including the following:

AndroidManifest.xml. -->
 This is an additional Android manifest file that describes the name, version, access rights, library and other contents of the APK file.
assets/. 
These are application assets and resource files included with the app.

classes.dex. --> 
These are compiled Java classes in the DEX file format that are run on the device.


lib/. --> 
This folder contains platform-dependent compiled code and native libraries for device-specific architectures, such as x86 or x86_64.


META-INF/. --> 
This folder contains the application certificate, manifest file, signature and a list of resources.


res/. -->
This is a directory that holds resources -- for example, images that are not already compiled into resources.arsc.

resources.arsc. -->
This is a file containing pre-compiled resources used by the app.
