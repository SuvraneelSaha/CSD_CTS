 Name 2 ways an application can hide an API from static analysis 
 Two ways an application can hide an API from static analysis are:

1. Dynamic API Invocation: Instead of directly calling an API, an application can load the required DLL dynamically using LoadLibrary and then retrieve the API's address using GetProcAddress. This approach prevents the API from being listed in the import table, making it harder to detect during static analysis.

Code for Understanding - 
HINSTANCE hDLL = LoadLibrary("User32.dll");
Msg MsgBox = (Msg)GetProcAddress(hDLL, "MessageBoxA");

2. API Name Obfuscation: An application can encode or encrypt the API name, making it difficult to identify during static analysis. For example, using base64 encoding to hide the API name MessageBoxA as TWVzc2FnZUJveEE=.

string APIName = base64_decode("TWVzc2FnZUJveEE=");
Msg MsgBox = (Msg)GetProcAddress(hDLL, APIName.c_str());

What is dynamic API invocation in malware obfuscation?

Dynamic API invocation in malware obfuscation is a technique used by adversaries to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis. It involves dynamically resolving API functions called by malware during runtime, rather than linking them statically. This approach prevents the API functions from being listed in the import table, making it harder to detect during static analysis.

In this technique, malware stores hashes of function names instead of literal strings. These hashes are then used to manually reproduce the linking and loading process using functions such as GetProcAddress() and LoadLibrary(). This approach allows malware to obfuscate API function calls until they are resolved and invoked during runtime, making it more challenging for defensive analysts to identify malicious activities.

How does base64 encoding help hide API names in malware?

In this example, the API name MessageBoxA is encoded using base64 encoding and stored in the APIName variable. The encoded string TWVzc2FnZUJveEE= is then passed to the GetProcAddress function to retrieve the address of the API function. This makes it more difficult for malware analysts to identify the API call during static analysis.

Code - 
#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>
#include "base64.h"

using namespace std;

typedef int (*Msg)(HWND, LPCTSTR, LPCTSTR, UINT);

int main()
{
    HINSTANCE hDLL = LoadLibrary("User32.dll");

    string APIName = base64_decode("TWVzc2FnZUJveEE=");

    if (hDLL == NULL) {
        std::cout << "Failed to load the library.\n";
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Library loaded.\n";
        std::cout << "Rio Test\n";
        Msg MsgBox = (Msg)GetProcAddress(hDLL, APIName.c_str());
        MsgBox(
            NULL,
            "Resource not available\nDo you want to try again?",
            "Account Details",
            MB_ICONWARNING | MB_CANCELTRYCONTINUE | MB_DEFBUTTON2
        );
    }
    FreeLibrary(hDLL);
    return 0;
}

What are some other encoding techniques used to hide API calls?

There are several encoding techniques used to hide API calls in malware. One such technique is to use XOR encoding with a specific key. Here's an example of PHP code that uses XOR encoding to hide an API call:

<?php
$key = "mysecretkey";
$api_name = "my_api_call";
$encoded_api_name = "";

for ($i = 0; $i < strlen($api_name); $i++) {
    $encoded_api_name .= $api_name[$i] ^ $key[$i % strlen($key)];
}

$api_call = 'api_' . $encoded_api_name;
$result = $api_call();
?>

In this example, the API name my_api_call is XOR-encoded using the key mysecretkey. The encoded API name is then used to call the API function. This makes it more difficult for malware analysts to identify the API call during static analysis.

Another encoding technique used to hide API calls is to use Base64 encoding, as I explained earlier. Here's an example of PHP code that uses Base64 encoding to hide an API call:

<?php
$api_name = "my_api_call";
$encoded_api_name = base64_encode($api_name);
$decoded_api_name = base64_decode($encoded_api_name);
$api_call = 'api_' . $decoded_api_name;
$result = $api_call();
?>

In this example, the API name my_api_call is Base64-encoded and then decoded to call the API function. This technique can also be used to hide API calls in malware.
