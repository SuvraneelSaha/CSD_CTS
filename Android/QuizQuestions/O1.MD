8.Write the code snippet to start a new activity named SecondActivity from FirstActivity
Intent nIntent = new Intent(FirstActivity.this , SecondActivity.class)
startActivity(nIntent);

as here it is been asked to start a new activity and also the target Activity has been given so we will be using the Explicit Intent for that use case .

10.Describe the role of Intent Filters in Android, and provide an example scenario where they are used.(Code snippet)
They allow an app to declare what types of intents it can handle. Intent Filters are specified in an appâ€™s manifest file (AndroidManifest.xml).
They define the types of intents that a component is interested in receiving.
 <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.SEND" />
        <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
        <!-- Accepts plain text data -->
        <data android:mimeType="text/plain" />
    </intent-filter>

11.Briefly explain the concept of PendingIntent and provide a use case where it is commonly used.(Code Snippet)
Pending Intent - It is a type of Intent that acts at a certain time , ie the intent gets executed after a delay or at a certain Time . It triggers the application or the System to do the action even if the app is not running or even if the System is in idle mode . 

Example of Usage of Pending Intent - Alarm , Battery Saver Notification 

 1. Define the Intent for launching the Alarm
Intent alarmIntent = new Intent(context, AlarmActivity.class);
alarmIntent.putExtra(alarm_ID, alarmName); // Pass any data needed

this .putExtra function lets us pass any data as a key value pair just like in a HashMap - 
Types of HashMap - TreeMap, HashMap and LinkedHashMap

here the alarmIntent is also a type of Intent 

2.  Creating a PendingIntent with the flag FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT

PendingIntent pendingIntent = PendingIntent.getActivity(context, 0,
alarmIntent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);

3. Build the notification with the PendingIntent

NotificationCompat.Builder notificationBuilder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(context, CHANNEL_ID)
.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_alarm_note)
.setContentTitle(alarmTitle)
.setContentText(alarmMessage)
.addAction(R.drawable.ic_alarmButton, "Stop", pendingIntent);

 // Add action with
PendingIntent

 4. Build and show the notification

Notification notification = notificationBuilder.build();

notificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, notification);

12.Explain the difference between explicit and implicit intents, and provide an example(Program) of each.
Implicit Intent - In case of Implicit intent , the Target Activity is not set , it depends upon the user to choose which Activity will be used. Also here the communication between the two components act between two different applications  , Example - when we want to share an image there will be lots of options to share and the choice to make to send the image via a particular application is in the hands of the user , and this is Implicit Intent 

Example of Implicit Intent - 
Intent intent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);
intent.setData(Uri.parse("http://www.example.com"));
startActivity(intent);


Explicit Intent - Here the Target Activity is already Set . The communication between two components happens between the components of the same application . 
Ex - Using the GCam , we use the camera that is provided by the GCam  
Whatsapp status , whenever we try to give a status in the Whatsapp it will open the Whatsapp camera only not the native camera one .

Example of Explicit Intent : 
Intent intent = new Intent(context, TargetActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);

13.How can you retrieve data passed from the previous activity in the target activity?
// Create an Intent object
Intent intent = new Intent(this, TargetActivity.class);

String message = "Hello from Source Activity!";
intent.putExtra("messageKey", message);

startActivity(intent);


// For Getting the Intent 

Intent intent = getIntent();
if (intent != null) {
String value = intent.getStringExtra(Name of the Key);
// Perform actions with the received data
}
