8.How can you communicate between a Fragment and its hosting Activity in Android? Provide an example with a code .
// In our Fragment
public class Myfragment extends Fragment {
    // Receive a message from the activity ie Hosting Activity 

    public void receiveMessage(String msg)
    {
        // Handle the message (e.g., update UI components)
        // For example, set a TextView's text

        TextView_Name.setText(msg);
    }
}

// In our Hosting Activity
public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
    // Create an instance of your fragment
    Myfragment frg = new Myfragment();

    // Call the method to pass data from the Activity to that of the Fragment 

    frg.receiveMessage("Hello from the activity!");

13.Which method should be overridden to inflate the layout for a Fragment?

onCreate()

onAttach()

onActivityCreated()

14.Describe the role of the onSaveInstanceState() method in both Activities and Fragments, and provide an example scenario where it is useful.
In Activities, onSaveInstanceState() is called before the onStop() method when the Activity is about to be paused or destroyed.
In Fragments, it is called before the onStop() method of the hosting Activity./

 Example - building a simple note-taking app with an Activity containing a Fragment for editing notes. 

Scenario:
The user is editing a note in the Fragment.
Suddenly, the app goes into the background (e.g., due to an incoming call or the user switching to another app).
Use Case:
You want to ensure that the user’s unsaved changes (the note content) are preserved even if the Activity or Fragment is destroyed during the background transition.

16.When using a Fragment in an activity, what is the recommended way to handle configuration changes (e.g., screen rotation)?

Use a retained Fragment

Use a global variable in the activity

Save and restore the Fragment's state in onSaveInstanceState()

Use SharedPreferences to store the state

17.Which method is called when an Activity is brought to the foreground after being in the background?

onResume()

onStart()

onCreate()

It is called before the activity is destroyed

It is called when the activity is no longer visible to the user

It is called when the activity is first created

It is called when the activity is first started

20.Explain the key differences between an Activity and a Fragment in Android.
Activity - 


An Activity represents a single screen or user interface component within an Android app.
Each Activity has its own lifecycle, UI layout, and interaction with the user.
Handles navigation between different parts of the app.
It is Used for top-level screens (e.g., login screen, settings screen).
Has a comprehensive lifecycle (e.g., onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), etc.).
Manages the entire screen and its layout.
It Communicates with other activities, services, and system components.
Starts other activities using startActivityForResult().


Fragment - 


A Fragment is a modular and reusable UI component.
It defines and manages its own layout, lifecycle, and input events.
Fragments cannot exist independently; they must be hosted by an Activity or another Fragment.
Used for smaller UI components within an Activity.
Ideal for creating dynamic and flexible UIs (e.g., master-detail views, tabbed interfaces).
Has its own lifecycle (similar to an Activity).
Attached to the hosting Activity’s lifecycle.
Manages a portion of the screen (a view hierarchy).
Can be added, replaced, or removed dynamically within an Activity.

Example - Suppose you’re building a news app with the following screens:

MainActivity: Displays a list of news articles.
ArticleDetailFragment: Shows the details of a selected article.

24.Describe the role of the onActivityResult() method in Android, and provide an example scenario where it is commonly used.
Purpose:
The onActivityResult() method is called when an activity that was started using startActivityForResult() finishes and returns a result.
It allows the calling activity to receive data or outcomes from the other activity.
You can use this callback to handle the result, process data, and update your UI accordingly.

Code - for sending data or result  from Second Activity to the Main Activity 

private static final int SECOND_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE = 0;

protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
    if (requestCode == SECOND_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_CODE) {
        if (resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
            String returnString = data.getStringExtra("result");
            Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, returnString, Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
        }
    }

25.Write code to dynamically add a Fragment to an Activity using the FragmentManager.
FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.fragmentContainer, fragment, "tag");
fragmentTransaction.commit();
